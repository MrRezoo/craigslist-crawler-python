While I qualify as a \u201cprivileged white male\u201d in oh so many ways - I\u2019m also feeling supremely stuck at the moment and could use some benevolence and support from this wild world if there just so happens to be anything spare to go around?\n\nA bit about me:\nI\u2019m a 34 year old social entrepreneur. I left a long term (gay) relationship just before the pandemic and for all intents and purposes, my proverbial \u201capple cart\u201d has all but blown up. The transition, which I expected to last for 6 months or so, has turned into a year and a half of near-constant strain and struggle as I attend to my health, healing, and work to get on my feet during the pandemic. For the most part, I\u2019ve needed to put my entrepreneurial endeavors on the back-burner so that I can keep up with rent and cost of living in San Diego. I\u2019m capable of this grind and hustle, but I\u2019m tired of it... and more importantly, the opportunity cost is mounting and simply feels too great. I feel this way of life breaking me down and sucking my spirit into a futile spiral of merely surviving...and that has never been a viable option for me.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.\u201d\n\u2015 Howard Thurman\n\nI\u2019m dreaming up a \"house manager\" or \"housesitting\" opportunity (maybe an unoccupied vacation home?) while I create and launch my new business. I\u2019m capable of paying up to $1,200/ mo for rent but would appreciate any breaks that you could offer in exchange for some service or support. How might I add value to your life? This could be a short or longer-term situation. There\u2019s not much that I need\u2026 but what I\u2019m seeking has proven exceedingly difficult to find which is why I\u2019m dropping this note on Craigslist as a sort of hail mary. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nHere's my dream list:\n\nAccess to nature and beauty (A room with a view?)\nSome space to work and move freely without tripping over myself!\nA touch of privacy - I want to dance and sing and play my (acoustic) guitar like nobody is listening!\n\nI\u2019m clean, educated, mindful, organized, trustworthy, respectful, and pleasant to be around...especially when I\u2019m not complaining. ;)\n\nMaybe you can relate to a dark night of the soul or had a similar chapter in your life? If my post has any resonance, please drop me a note and let me know if I can answer any questions. I\u2019m also happy to share references, social media, credit, work history, etc. It would be a pleasure and privilege to connect.\n\nThanks for your consideration and your big human heart.\n\nMuch gratitude,\nMark    ", "post_id": "7293600936", "created_time": "2021-03-19T06:24:15+0100", "images": [{"url": "https://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_dIiRz1JRrABz_0bC0fu_600x450.jpg", "flag": false}]}
