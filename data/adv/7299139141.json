Cleanliness and tolerance are required (on my side, no taboos regarding your situation or orientation). If you are psycho-rigid, you will be unhappy with me. If you are a foreigner, expect me to be curious to hear about your country, but I can also be discreet. Taste for photography, theater, art, work.\nSimple rules of life: we are among responsible adults, so there is no need to organize cleaning or garbage tricks. Everyone does their own dishes and cleans the common rooms after use. \nMobility or student lease or short stay (before eventually moving on to a longer stay). The rent includes everything (electricity, internet, washing machine, breakfast if stay less than a week). Price : 20/night, 120/week, 480/month.
